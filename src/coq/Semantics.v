(* Re-export of the main notions required to define the semantics of vir programs.
   Use `From TwoPhase Require Import Semantics.` to get in scope most things necessary
   to state facts about vir's semantics.

   Note: We avoid as much as possible to import notations. You therefore additionally
   need `Import SemNotations.` to get them in scope. The available notations can be
   found in `Semantics/InterpretationStack.SemNotations`.
